# Object Diagrams

## Purpose

- Model the things in the problem domain before classifiying them as classes
- Model how state changes in response to events of activities
- Reason about objects that will exist at run-time and how they will interact with one another using sequence or communication diagrams

```plantuml
@startuml
object "schedule: Schedule" as S {

}

object ":TimedEvent1" as T1
object ":TimedEvent2" as T2

S --> T1
S --> T2


@enduml
```

## State

- Objects change over time
- Operations change attribute values and links
- Some changes are significant and represent changes of state

## Attributes and State

- Attribute values can be shown in an object diagram to illustrate change to state
- The values are held in slots, which represent attributes in the class diagram

```plantuml
@startuml
object "currentDevice[Open]: OpenClosedDevice" as CD {
    enabled = false
    state = open
    name = Window Blind Master Bedroom
}
object "schedule: Schedule" as S
object ":TimedEvent" as T1 {
    action = SwitchOff
    time = 07:00
}
object ":TimedEvent" as T2 {
    action = SwitchOn
    time = 12:00
}
object ":TimedEvent" as T3
object ":TimedEvent" as T4

CD "+currentDevice" -- S
S "+schedule" -- T1: contains
S "+schedule" -- T2: contains
S "+schedule" -- T3: contains
S "+schedule" -- T4: contains
