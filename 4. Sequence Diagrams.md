# Sequence Diagrams

## Purpose of Sequence Diagrams

- Provide a view of the interaction between elements of the system at a number of different levels
- Support use cases by specifiying the detailed interaction
- Explore alternative scenarios in more detail
- Anylse interaction in tests

### Interaction in the system

- Model interaction at different levels:
  - Components or subsystems
  - Active Objects
  - Within a use case
  - Within an operation

### Specify Use Case Interaction

- Shows the detailed interaction to support a use case:
  - At the user interface
  - Among other objects

### Explore alternative scenarios

- Different sequence diagrams can be produced for different instances of a use case
- Sequence diagrams can include alternative paths through the interaction

### Analyses interaction in tests

- A debugger stack trace can be converted to a sequence diagram and compared with the design

## Basic Notation of Sequence Diagrams

- Lifelines
- Messages
- Signals
- Execution Specification

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Foo1
boundary Foo2
entity Foo4 #99FF99
database Foo5
collections Foo6
Foo1 -> Foo2 : To boundary
create control Foo3
Foo1 -> Foo3 : To control
Foo1 -> Foo4 : To entity
Foo1 -> Foo5 : To database
Foo1 -> Foo6 : To collections

@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
[-> Bob
[o-> Bob
[o->o Bob
[x-> Bob

[<- Bob
[x<- Bob

Bob ->]
Bob ->o]
Bob o->o]
Bob ->x]

Bob <-]
Bob x<-]
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
hide footbox
box "Internal Service" #LightBlue
	participant Bob
	participant Alice
end box

!pragma teoz true

{start} Alice -> Bob : start doing things during duration
Bob -> Max : something
Max -> Bob : something else
{end} Bob -> Alice : finish

{start} <-> {end} : some time

@enduml
```

### Lifelines

- Represent instances, usually of objects, in an interaction
- Rectangle with name of object
- Line down the page, usually dashed
- Also used for actor
- Time in a sequence diagram runs down the page
- Distance between two events does not represent a literal difference in time (no scale)

### Messages

- Lifelines sind and receive messages or signals
- Message types

```plantuml
@startuml
A -> B
B --> Device ** : Creation
B -> Device: Synchronous
B <-- Device: Reply
B ->> Device: Asynchronous
B -> Device !!: Deletion
B -> A
@enduml
```

### Execution Specifications

- Shown as a rectangle on the lifeline
- Represent the execution of code by the object

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Engineer as E order 1
participant "controller\nAddDeviceController" as C order 3
activate E

E -->> C **: AddDeviceController()
create AddDeviceUi as A order 2
activate C
C -->> A ++: AddDeviceUI()
A -> A ++: display()
deactivate A
deactivate C
E -> A: deviceName()
deactivate A
deactivate A
A -> C ++: actionPerformed(event)
activate A
return updateDisplay()
activate A
@enduml
```

### Active Objects

- Active objects are instances of classes flagged as Active
- Active objects execute their behaviour as soon as they are created
- Run on own thread of control
- Lifelines have two lines at the sides

- States can also be displayed in sequence diagrams as a ellipse on the lifeline

## Timing and Duration Constraints

- Observations
  - Time
  - Duration
- Constraints
  - Time
  - Duration
- Allow message to slant down

## Interaction Occurrences

- Reusable sequence diagrams
- Interaction occurrences
- Referencing interaction occurrences
- Gates

### Reusable Sequence Diagrams

- Sequence diagrams can very quickly get very complex
- This diagram has been deliberately simplified
- Interaction occurrences allow us to put parts of a diagram into a separate diagram to simplify the main diagrams and make them more manageable
- These are called interaction occurrences
- Ideally they should be reusable in other diagrams

**Referencing Occurrences**

- Frame with _ref_ in the top left and the name of the interaction occurrences that is being referenced in the center

```plantuml
@startuml
@startuml
participant Alice
actor Bob

ref over Alice, Bob : init

Alice -> Bob : hello

ref over Bob
  This can be on
  several lines
end ref
@enduml
```

### Gates

- Where messages go into or come out of an interaction occurrence there is a gate
- Gates must match the containing diagram

## Combined Fragments

- Keywords in plantuml
  - alt/else
  - opt
  - loop
  - par
  - break
  - critical
  - group, gefolgt von einem anzuzeigenden Text

```plantuml
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request

alt successful case

	Bob -> Alice: Authentication Accepted

else some kind of failure

	Bob -> Alice: Authentication Failure
	group My own label
		Alice -> Log : Log attack start
	    loop 1000 times
	        Alice -> Bob: DNS Attack
	    end
		Alice -> Log : Log attack end
    end

    opt x > y
        Alice -> Log: blubb
    end

else Another type of failure

   Bob -> Alice: Please repeat

end
